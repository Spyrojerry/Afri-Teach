Use the changelog file to keep track of development, create if there's none.
Then use the development-phases.md file to know the stage a project is at, and the prd.md file for reference.
Don't run npm run build until I'm done with the building of my project, and I tell you to do so.
If you're to build a new page, make sure to follow the pattern of the existing pages.
